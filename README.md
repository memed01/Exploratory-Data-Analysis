Exploratory-Data-Analysis
=========================
This is my repository for the Course Project 1 of course "Exploratory Data Analysis". 
Currently there are 8 files: 4 png pictures and 4 scripts to generate each.

Those scripts perform the following actions:

Download the data from here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip;

Extract the data into ./data/household_power_consumption.zip;

Download the scripts (plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R, plot4.R) to some directory.
